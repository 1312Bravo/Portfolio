### About

Some days, a run feels effortless. The trails are forgiving, the legs respond, and every kilometer seems to pass in a blur. Other days, even a short loop feels heavy—your lungs burn, your legs ache, and you wonder if you should even have laced up. The same workout can feel different and has a different effect depending on what you’ve done in the days or weeks before. Raw distance, time or heart rate alone can be misleading when assessing effort. 

As runners, we all experience these highs and lows. But what if there was a way to put today’s effort into context—to see whether you’re genuinely pushing your limits or simply running within what your body is ready for? That’s exactly the question this post explores: how to quantify your relative training load, so each run, ride, or session tells a story about progress, adaptation, and safety.

In this post, we’ll focus on one specific metric: normalizing today’s training load relative to your recent history. There are other metrics out there—each with its strengths and limitations—but here we’ll dive deep into this one approach. By comparing current sessions to your typical training patterns, you can get a clearer picture of whether you’re progressing safely or stepping into risky territory that could lead to overtraining or injury.

We’ll show how combining todays effort with recent averages and peak efforts can give a simple yet powerful metric, which gives you a data-driven perspective on every session. 

The goal is to provide a simple, practical metric that helps answer questions like:
- Am I pushing into new territory today?
- Is my current load within a safe range based on what I’ve done in the past weeks?
- Could this workout increase my risk of overtraining or injury if repeated too often?

By the end of this post, you’ll understand how to put each training session into context, see the bigger picture of your progress, and make informed decisions about how to plan future sessions safely and effectively.

### Deep dive

When it comes to measuring today’s effort, there are several options: distance, time, heart rate, pace, or best combination of all of them. Each tells part of the story. Distance and time capture volume, heart rate reflects intensity, and pace shows how much stress you put on your muscles and joints. But taken alone, none of these gives the full picture.

That’s why we focus on training load, a metric that combines duration, intensity, and heart rate into a single number. It is provided from all of ours smart wearables. It’s a practical way to capture both volume and intensity in one value, making comparisons across very different sessions much more meaningful. Additionaly, because our main sport of interest is trail and mountain running, on trails, distance or pace can be misleading. There can be technical trails with steep climbs, uneven terrain and dangerous esctions, make it hard to judge intensity from speed or distance alone. Training load, however, tries to account for the actual physiological stress of a session, capturing how your body is working regardless of terrain. We will talk more about it in some upcoming posts.

While training load is our main metric, the same approach can be applied to others—distance, time, or heart rate. By calculating relative values for each, we can see the story from multiple angles. Today’s high training load might coincide with a moderate distance or unusually high heart rate, offering deeper insight into how your body responded. Additional power comes when we combine these perspectives.
