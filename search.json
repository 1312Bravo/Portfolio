    "text": "I see everything in life through the prism of mathematics or statistics. It’s no different with sports, especially running (or cycling). This blog will be a place where I combine my passion for endurance sports with professional background in data science. Just as I enjoy solving equations or structuring data models at work, I enjoy applying that same curiosity to my own training. Training logs, race preparation, and performance modeling — all of these can be enriched by numbers, models, and careful analysis.\nAnother motivation behind starting this blog is that I recently began working with a coach. That gave me an extra push to look deeper into how we are structuring the training, how I’m progressing, and to better understand the “why” behind what we’re doing. It’s not only about following workouts but also about making sense of the bigger picture, seeing how the plan unfolds, and how the numbers reflect adaptation and improvement.\nNumbers, when put into context, tell a story: whether I’m adapting, improving, or stepping into risky territory. That’s why each blog post will focus on a specific question and explore how mathematical thinking can bring clarity—whether it’s about training load, heart rate, distance, or other aspects of performance. This blog is my way of sharing that journey—where mountains, trails, and bikes meet mathematics, analytics, and a touch of artistry.\n\n    \n     Check out the full \n     GitHub repository \n    for this project\n\n\nTrack Your Training Smarter - Data\nKeep all your training and daily metrics in one place without lifting a finger. With a Python pipeline connecting Garmin Connect to Google Sheets, your workouts and daily metrics update automatically every day. The result: a complete, always-current record that makes analysis, trend spotting, and make data-driven decisions precise.\n\n\nIncrease your chances of staying away from running injuries - Relative training load\nPut today’s training into context by comparing it with your recent history or, looking forward, use that perspective to decide how much load to take on in your next session. The idea is to give yourself a clearer picture of whether you’re pushing into new territory or staying within safe limits. The goal is to help you understand your training load better, catch signs of overtraining early, and reduce the risk of injuries while keeping your progress moving forward."

    "text": "Before diving into analysis, it’s worth showing where the numbers come from. I wanted a consistent and automated way to capture my training.\nTwo main datasets are daily updated and live in Google Sheets. Having the data in this format makes it easy to explore manually, but also gives me a flexible base for deeper analysis. I provide only a static sample of data logs.\n\nTraining Log – workouts with different metrics, including distance, duration, elevation, heart rate.\nDaily Log – day-level statistics, such as steps, sleep, resting heart rate, recovery time, and other daily metrics.\n\nThe statistics come from the Garmin Connect API. A Python script fetches both activity and daily statistics, and then pushes them into the Google Sheets. Some metrics are raw Garmin values, while others are adjusted or calculated. Statistics that are captured in sheets can also evolve over time as we discover new metrics or further analyze training. So, some of the statistics in the sheet can also be presented in details in other blog posts.\nThe script is run each morning and spreadsheets expand by one more day of history (yesterday’s data), keeping the logs synchronized without manual work. The script can also loop through multiple accounts if provided.\nThe script relies two key integrations:\n\nGarmin Connect API – fetch activities and health metrics.\n\nfrom garminconnect import Garmin  \n\ngarminClient = Garmin(user_email, user_password)  \ngarminClient.login()\ngarminClient.get_activities_by_date(date_from, date_to)\n\nGoogle Sheets API – store and update logs.\n\nimport gspread\nfrom google.oauth2.service_account import Credentials  \n\ndrive_credentials = Credentials.from_service_account_file(\n    \"googleDrive_secrets.json\",  \n    scopes=[\"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets\",  \n            \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive\"]  \n)\n\ngoogleDrive_client = gspread.authorize(drive_credentials)  \ngoogleDrive_client.open(user_dailyLogFilename)\nOf course, logging in requires credentials (emails, passwords, API keys). They are not hardcoded, but live in a .env file locally and as GitHub Secrets in the cloud, keeping sensitive content secure while still accessible for automation.\n\n    \n     You can find the full code for this part on my Github repository under the\n     related branch \n    ."

On this site, I share projects, experiments, and stories that spark my curiosity.\nThese posts come from my own independent interests—questions I want to explore, datasets I find intriguing, or challenges that push me to think differently. Each project may be explored through multiple blog-style posts, each focusing on a different aspect, insight, or experiment. This allows me to break complex topics into digestible pieces while following a clear narrative. Each one is an opportunity to apply mathematics, statistics, and analytical thinking in a way that’s both rigorous and creative.\nI aim to make insights clear, actionable, and occasionally even artistic. I share not just results, but the thought process, experiments, and learning along the way. My hope is that every post inspires you to look at problems differently, question assumptions, and maybe spark your own experiments."

    "text": "About\nSome days, a run feels effortless and every kilometer seems to pass in a blur. Other days, even a short loop feels heavy and you wonder if you should even have laced up. The same workout has a different effect depending on what you’ve done in the days or weeks before. Raw distance, time or heart rate alone can be misleading when assessing effort.\nAs runners, we all experience these highs and lows. But what if there was a way to put today’s effort into context—to see whether you’re genuinely pushing your limits or simply running within what your body is ready for? That’s exactly the question this post explores: how to quantify your relative training load, so each session tells a story about progress, adaptation, and safety.\nWe’ll focus on one specific metric: normalizing today’s training load relative to recent history. By comparing current sessions to your typical training patterns, you can get a clearer picture of whether you’re progressing safely or stepping into risky territory that could lead to overtraining or injury.\nThe goal is to provide a simple, practical metric that helps answer questions like: - Am I pushing into new territory today? - Is my current load within a safe range based on what I’ve done in the past weeks? - Could this workout increase my risk of overtraining or injury if repeated too often?\nBy the end of this post, you’ll understand how to put each training session into context, see the bigger picture of your progress, and make informed decisions about how to plan future sessions safely and effectively.\n\n\nSelecting the metric\nWhen it comes to measuring effort in endurance sports, there are several options: distance, time, heart rate, pace or something else. Best is combination of all, as each tells part of the story. Taken alone, none of these gives the full picture. Also, as my priority is trail running, also the type of activity, on which most of the data is based on, it makes it hard to judge intensity from speed or distance alone.\nThat’s why we focus on training load, a metric that combines duration, intensity, and heart rate into a single number. It is provided from all of ours smart wearables and a practical way to capture both volume and intensity in one value, making comparisons across very different sessions (and sports) much more meaningful. It tries to account for the actual physiological stress of a session, capturing how your body is working regardless of terrain or event sport. We will talk more about it in some upcoming posts.\nWhile training load will be our main metric, the same approach can be applied to others, also mentioned above. By calculating relative values for each, we can see the story from multiple angles. The power comes when we can successfuly combine different perspectives.\n\n\nDeep dive\nDifferent platforms and devices provide their own Training Load (TL) metrics, each based on a different formula or physiological model. We will use Garmin’s Training Load values provided in our training log. Garmin TL is based on EPOC (Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption) - a physiological response.\nAbsolute TL values are useful, but they lack context: they don’t tell us how today’s load compares to what our body is currently adapted to. Garmin’s Training Load values are absolute — a TL of 200 means the same physiological stress no matter who performs it. But what that stress means depends on context. For a beginner, 200 might feel overwhelming; for an elite, it might feel trivial. Even for the same athlete, a TL of 200 can feel very different depending on whether you’re coming off a heavy week (where it feels easy) or off several rest days (where it feels harder).\nOur goal is to define a Relative Training Load (RTL) metric that normalizes today’s TL against recent history. By putting training load into context, RTL allows us to better understand whether today’s effort is appropriate, progressive, and safe for long-term adaptation.\nThe idea of comparing current workload to past workload isn’t new. Sports science has long used the Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR) to capture how today’s training compares to longer-term training history. But ACWR has well-known limitations: it usually relies on a single rolling average, and it can miss important context about peak efforts or variation in load. That’s where our approach comes in. We’ll start from the same foundation but further extend it nto a more flexible and informative framework."
